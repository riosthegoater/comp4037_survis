        "abstract": "Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.",

        "abstract": "\"Training machine learning (ML) models typically involves expensive iterative optimization. Once the model\\'s final parameters are released, there is currently no mechanism for the entity which trained the model to prove that these parameters were indeed the result of this optimization procedure. Such a mechanism would support security of ML applications in several ways. For instance, it would simplify ownership resolution when multiple parties contest ownership of a specific model. It would also facilitate the distributed training across untrusted workers where Byzantine workers might otherwise mount a denial-of-service by returning incorrect model updates. In this paper, we remediate this problem by introducing the concept of proof-of-learning in ML. Inspired by research on both proof-of-work and verified computations, we observe how a seminal training algorithm, stochastic gradient descent, accumulates secret information due to its stochasticity. This produces a natural construction for a proof-of-learning which demonstrates that a party has expended the compute require to obtain a set of model parameters correctly. In particular, our analyses and experiments show that an adversary seeking to illegitimately manufacture a proof-of-learning needs to perform *at least* as much work than is needed for gradient descent itself. We also instantiate a concrete proof-of-learning mechanism in both of the scenarios described above. In model ownership resolution, it protects the intellectual property of models released publicly. In distributed training, it preserves availability of the training procedure. Our empirical evaluation validates that our proof-of-learning mechanism is robust to variance induced by the hardware (ML accelerators) and software stacks.\",",

        "abstract": "\"Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) represent a revolutionary advance in computational integrity and privacy technology, enabling the secure and private exchange of information without revealing underlying private data. ZKPs have unique advantages in terms of universality and minimal security assumptions when compared to other privacy-sensitive computational methods for distributed systems, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. Their application spans multiple domains, from enhancing privacy in blockchain to facilitating confidential verification of computational tasks. This survey starts with a high-level overview of the technical workings of ZKPs with a focus on an increasingly relevant subset of ZKPs called zk-SNARKS. While there have been prior surveys on the algorithmic and theoretical aspects of ZKPs, our work is distinguished by providing a broader view of practical aspects and describing many recently-developed use cases of ZKPs across various domains. These application domains span blockchain privacy, scaling, storage, and interoperability, as well as non-blockchain applications like voting, authentication, timelocks, and machine learning. Aimed at both practitioners and researchers, the survey also covers foundational components and infrastructure such as zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVM), domain-specific languages (DSLs), supporting libraries, frameworks, and protocols. We conclude with a discussion on future directions, positioning ZKPs as pivotal in the advancement of cryptographic practices and digital privacy across many applications.\",",

        "abstract": "\"AbstractThe widespread adoption of cloud computing has dramatically altered how data is stored, processed, and accessed in an era. The rapid development of digital technologies characterizes all this. The widespread adoption of cloud services has introduced new obstacles to guaranteeing secure and expeditious access to sensitive data. Organizations of all types find user-friendly and cost-effective solutions crucial, which is why they consider cloud services essential. The availability of the cloud hampers access control security in systems that are constantly and remotely changing. Conventional methods of access control are efficient, but the advanced world of technology exposes them to more threats. Applying blockchain technology to cloud access control systems, which are decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof, has overcome these challenges. This paper aims to discuss the potential of blockchain in enhancing access management, security and trust in cloud computing. Besides, this scholarly article reviews the evolving area of blockchain-based access control systems and synthesizes the findings of 118 selected papers from various academic repositories. Based on this systematic review of the studies, twelve different types of blockchain-based access control paradigms can be identified. This work provides a critical analysis of the research on blockchain technology in access control systems, with a focus on scalability, compatibility, and security challenges. It also highlights areas that require further research and proposes directions for future research to advance this rapidly growing area of scholarship.\",",

        "abstract": "\"Debugging and auditing zero-knowledge-compatible smart contracts remains a significant challenge due to the lack of source mapping in compilers such as zkSolc. In this work, we present a preliminary source mapping framework that establishes traceability between Solidity source code, LLVM IR, and zkEVM bytecode within the zkSolc compilation pipeline. Our approach addresses the traceability challenges introduced by non-linear transformations and proof-friendly optimizations in zero-knowledge compilation. To improve the reliability of mappings, we incorporate lightweight consistency checks based on static analysis and structural validation. We evaluate the framework on a dataset of 50 benchmark contracts and 500 real-world zkSync contracts, observing a mapping accuracy of approximately 97.2% for standard Solidity constructs. Expected limitations arise in complex scenarios such as inline assembly and deep inheritance hierarchies. The measured compilation overhead remains modest, at approximately 8.6%. Our initial results suggest that source mapping support in zero-knowledge compilation pipelines is feasible and can benefit debugging, auditing, and development workflows. We hope that this work serves as a foundation for further research and tool development aimed at improving developer experience in zk-Rollup environments.\",",

        "abstract": "\"AbstractCloud computing enables highly configurable and reliable computing resources on a rentable per-use scheme, facilitating quick and cost-effective provisioning of large-scale applications. Thanks to the fast-paced evolution of cutting-edge technologies and the rapid spread of cloud-based solutions, the cloud computing ecosystem is now part of our everyday lives. Nevertheless, cloud computing relies on highly sophisticated data centers comprising energy-consuming servers and equipment that require much energy. Stimulating cloud services for active participation and network contributions presents several challenges. Strategies based on artificial intelligence (AI), game theory, and blockchain have great potential to create an economically sustainable cloud ecosystem. This paper explores strategies grounded in AI, game theory, and blockchain to foster an economically sustainable cloud ecosystem. Informed by a survey study, our research delves into incentive approaches within cloud computing. Theoretical foundations, motivations, and enabling techniques are comprehensively examined to provide valuable insights for a broad audience. The primary contributions of this work lie in elucidating the application of AI, game theory, and blockchain to address challenges in incentivizing cloud services, paving the way for a more sustainable and efficient cloud computing landscape.\",",

        "abstract": "\"Crowdsourcing websites (e.g. Yahoo! Answers, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and etc.) emerged in recent years that allow requesters from all around the world to post tasks and seek help from an equally global pool of workers. However, intrinsic incentive problems reside in crowdsourcing applications as workers and requester are selfish and aim to strategically maximize their own benefit. In this paper, we propose to provide incentives for workers to exert effort using a novel game-theoretic model based on repeated games. As there is always a gap in the social welfare between the non-cooperative equilibria emerging when workers pursue their self-interests and the desirable Pareto efficient outcome, we propose a novel class of incentive protocols based on social norms which integrates reputation mechanisms into the existing pricing schemes currently implemented on crowdsourcing websites, in order to improve the performance of the non-cooperative equilibria emerging in such applications. We first formulate the exchanges on a crowdsourcing website as a two-sided market where requesters and workers are matched and play gift-giving games repeatedly. Subsequently, we study the protocol designer\\'s problem of finding an optimal and sustainable (equilibrium) protocol which achieves the highest social welfare for that website. We prove that the proposed incentives protocol can make the website operate close to Pareto efficiency. Moreover, we also examine an alternative scenario, where the protocol designer aims at maximizing the revenue of the website and evaluate the performance of the optimal protocol.\",",

        "abstract": "\"In the context of cloud computing, services are held on cloud servers, where the clients send their data to the server and obtain the results returned by server. However, the computation, data and results are prone to tampering due to the vulnerabilities on the server side. Thus, verifying the integrity of computation is important in the client-server setting. The cryptographic method known as Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is renowned for facilitating private and verifiable computing. ZKP allows the client to validate that the results from the server are computed correctly without violating the privacy of the server\\'s intellectual property. Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zkSNARKs), in particular, has been widely applied in various applications like blockchain and verifiable machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing zkSNARKs approaches remain highly computationally intensive. For instance, even basic operations like matrix multiplication require an extensive number of constraints, resulting in significant overhead. In addressing this challenge, we introduce \\textbackslashtextit{zkVC}, which optimizes the ZKP computation for matrix multiplication, enabling rapid proof generation on the server side and efficient verification on the client side. zkVC integrates optimized ZKP modules, such as Constraint-reduced Polynomial Circuit (CRPC) and Prefix-Sum Query (PSQ), collectively yielding a more than 12-fold increase in proof speed over prior methods.
